## 9.1 Commission (server-priced)
| Profile | Platform commission |
|---------|---------------------|
| Proximité (`shop_kind=proximite`) | **5%** |
| Particulier / boutique standard / enseigne | **8%** |

Clients may preview; **backend wins**.

## 9.2 Pricing model
- Seller sets **net** amount they want.  
- Buyer pays **gross** (net + commission and any fee components).  
- Document formula in API so app/web match.

## 9.3 Escrow (pending until goods OK)

**Core rule:** after payment, money is **held**. It is **not** credited to the seller’s withdrawable balance until release.

1. Payment success → `escrowHold` (pending).  
2. Delivery / pickup happens while funds stay held.  
3. **Buyer confirms receipt** (or policy auto-confirm) → `escrowRelease` → seller wallet.  
4. If **litige** opened (buyer **or** seller) → remain locked until resolve or seller voluntary refund.  
5. **Seller voluntary refund** allowed while held → funds back to buyer (full/partial).  
6. Admin outcomes: `refund_buyer` | `partial_refund` | `release_seller`.
